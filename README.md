# WFX

> Scene opens: two developers staring at a terminal. One of them hasn't slept in 36 hours :(

**Dev 1:** Dawg... what even *is* this thing?<br>
**Dev 2:** Haven't you heard about it?<br>
**Dev 1:** No? Tf is WFX?<br>
**Dev 2:** Weird Framework<br>
**Dev 1:** ...wat?<br>
**Dev 2:** eXactly (.\_.)<br>
**Dev 1:** (.\_.)<br>

**Silence...** <br>The fans sound like a jet engine. The build somehow finishes.
Somewhere, a socket coughs itself awake.
No logs, no confetti, just a binary sitting there opening its eyes for the first time.

## Architecture

Everything runs on one event loop.  
Epoll / IoUring / IOCP is the heartbeat.  

## Folder Structure

**cli/** - command-line tools: build, new, dev, doctor<br>
**config/** - TOML loader<br>
**engine/** - runtime core, template execution<br>
**http/** - routing, parser, serializer, response machinery, etc.<br>
**os_specific/** - Linux and Windows platform code<br>
**shared/** - internal shared logic<br>
**include/** - public headers for user extensions<br>

## Shared Libraries (`lib/`)

Each shared module is self-contained and linked into the core runtime.

- **utils/** - logging, crypto, memory, file I/O, etc.<br>
- **async/** - custom coroutine functions without the use of C++20 stuff.<br>

## Build

Follow each command step by step to build the engine binary:

```bash
 - git clone https://github.com/Altered-commits/WFX.git
 - cd wfx
 - cmake -S . -B build
 - cmake --build build
```

Now that the engine binary has been created, follow these steps to use `wfx`:

#### OS-Specific Commands

#### Linux / macOS
```bash
 - mv wfx ..
 - cd ..
```
#### Windows (PowerShell)
```bash
 - Move-Item wfx ..
 - Set-Location ..
```
#### Windows (CMD)
```bash
 - move wfx ..
 - cd ..
```

Now you can start using `wfx` :)
