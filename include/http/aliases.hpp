 * This file may seem redundant and is like 99% redundant
 * But what my thought process is simple
 * This included user alises, basically instead of user using WFX::Http::SomeRandomStuff::Idk
 * User can directly do 'Idk', and its easier for them as well
 * Easier for user (Mostly for beginners). IMPORTANT -> This file is for Http aliases
 * You get the point... hopefully
