/*
 * This file may seem redundant and is like 99% redundant
 * But what my thought process is simple
 * This included user alises, basically instead of user using WFX::Http::SomeRandomStuff::Idk
 * User can directly do 'Http::SomeRandomStuff::Idk' or directly 'Idk' for some stuff
 * Pretty much either removing the common 'WFX' namespace or entirely aliasing for more-
 * -commonly used stuff
