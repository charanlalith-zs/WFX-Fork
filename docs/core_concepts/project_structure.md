# Project Structure

This page explains the default folder and file layout generated by WFX when you create a new project using:

```bash
./wfx new <project_name>
```

Understanding this structure will help you know where files live, what each directory is responsible for, and how WFX serves content.

## Directory Overview

A freshly generated WFX project looks like this:

<pre class="code-format">
&lt;your_workspace&gt;/
├─ &lt;your_project_name&gt;/
│  ├─ build/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ main.cpp
│  │  └─ api_entry.cpp
│  │
│  ├─ templates/
│  │  └─ index.html
│  │
│  └─ public/
│     ├─ style.css
│     └─ script.js
│
├─ WFX/
│  └─ (engine source code)
│
├─ wfx.toml
├─ toolchain.toml
└─ wfx
</pre>

Each directory and file has a specific purpose, explained below.

---

## `<your_project_name>/`

This directory contains **your application code and assets**.  
Everything inside this folder belongs to your WFX project.

---

### `build/`

Contains generated build artifacts which are created and managed automatically by WFX and the build system.

This directory can be safely deleted at any time and **must not be edited manually**.

---

### `src/`

This directory contains all C++ source files that implement your application logic.

By default, main.cpp is provided with a few example routes to demonstrate basic functionality. You are free to modify or remove this file as needed. You may also add any number of additional C++ source files and subdirectories inside `src/`.

The WFX build system automatically discovers and compiles all `.cpp` files located under `src/`, including those inside nested folders. File and directory naming is entirely up to you, with one exception: **api_entry.cpp**.

**api_entry.cpp** is a special, engine-required file and must not be modified or deleted. It is used internally by WFX to wire application code into the engine.

---

### `templates/`

This directory is dedicated to storing all HTML files that the server can render and deliver to clients. It should exclusively contain `.html` files, whether they are static pages (fixed content) or dynamic templates (rendered with SSR).

No other file types - such as CSS, JavaScript, or images - should be placed here.

---

### `public/`

This folder contains all files that are publicly accessible. This includes CSS, JavaScript, images, and any other static assets. Files placed here are automatically served by WFX when a request hits the **/public/** route, and can be accessed directly via that route regardless of whether they are referenced by any template (`.html`).

!!! warning "Important"
    Do not place any sensitive or private files in this folder. All content here is publicly visible. This directory is strictly for static assets meant to be accessible by anyone, and the system assumes no responsibility for accidental exposure.

---

## `WFX/`

The `WFX/` folder contains the source code of the WFX engine. It is required for building and running the project, as it represents the framework itself rather than your application code.

In most cases, you do not need to modify anything in this directory. It is meant to provide the core functionality of the framework and should be treated as a stable, internal component of the project.

---

## `wfx.toml`

The `wfx.toml` file is the main configuration file for the entire workspace. It defines settings for both your project and the WFX engine, and its scope is workspace-wide by design. This file is required for the project to function correctly and should be version-controlled.

!!! note    
    Currently, WFX supports only one project per workspace/namespace. Make sure to structure your workspace accordingly, as multiple projects in the same namespace are not supported.

---

## `toolchain.toml`

Generated automatically by running:

```bash
./wfx doctor
```

It stores compiler and toolchain settings used by WFX during builds.

!!! warning "Caution"
    This file can be modified if you know exactly what you are doing and understand the implications of changing compiler or linker flags. Incorrect modifications may break builds or produce unstable binaries. For most users, it is recommended to leave this file as-is.

## `wfx`

The `wfx` file is the compiled engine and command-line interface for WFX, built from the `WFX/` folder using CMake. It powers most of the framework's functionality, including project creation, workspace checks, running the development server, and so on.

Common commands include:

```bash
 * build    -   Pre-Build various parts of WFX
 * doctor   -   Verify system requirements
 * dev      -   Start WFX dev server
 * new      -   Create a new WFX project
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have an overview of the project structure, you can start exploring how to work with WFX:

- **Engine Commands**: Learn how `wfx` CLI works. See [Engine Commands](engine_commands.md) for details.  
- **Configuration**: Understand and modify `wfx.toml` to customize project settings. See [WFX Settings](wfx_toml.md) for details.  
- **Toolchain**: Learn how `toolchain.toml` affects compilation and build behavior. See [Toolchain Settings](toolchain_toml.md) for details.  

!!! tip
    Most daily work happens in your project folder. Avoid modifying `WFX/` or engine-related files unless you know exactly what you are doing.
