To implement (In no specific order):
1. Auto user code compiling into dll (Done)
2. Middleware (Done)
3. HTTPS (Done)
4. Per route middleware (Done)
5. Hot-Reload
6. HTML Templating (SSR) ('include' and 'partial' done, need to add 'extends', 'block')
7. DB support
8. HTTP 2 and 3 support
9. Rate Limiting (Done: Connection and Request)
10. Timeout (Done)

To Fix:
1. Cache files < 4KB, don't use TransmitFile / sendfile on every single file
2. Batch syscalls (for receving and sending data) instead of spamming them every request
3. Implement sending file via write call for stuff without sendfile support (Ex: OpenSSL's SSL_sendfile)
